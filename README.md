# YAGC: Yet Another Git CLI

> YAGC is a git cli that is built on top of go.

## Features / Goals

1. Nearly the same usage as `Git` (or at least the same subset)
2. Similar object models and data structures as `Git`
3. Concise and easy to use

## About

1. `YAGC` is not 100% compatible with `Git` (namely the `.git` directory)
2. `YAGC` uses no code of `Git`
3. `YAGC` is licensed under the [AGPLv3 License](LICENSE)
